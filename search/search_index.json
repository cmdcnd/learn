Determined adversaries WILL gain a foothold on endpoints through phishing or drive by downloads.  Patching will deter some of these attacks, such as browser bugs.  The initial foothold will be in user space, and often the adversary will attempt to escalate their privileges to local admin or system.  Patching will help to deter these also, but know that there are new techniques are discovered fairly frequently.  </p> <p>After an adversary has their initial foothold they will also begin to map/explore the network.  They will look for Remote Code Execution (RCE) opportunities to laterally move to other systems.  MS17-010 is an example of a current RCE that was released this year.  Microsoft Corporation, 2017  Using their initial foothold, an adversary can tunnel traffic through this system to attack any systems with this vulnerability.Example  Even though the patch was released within a month of the vulnerability disclosure, we are still finding systems on every network with this vulnerability.  This type of vulnerability would also allow adversaries to move directly to a server system without having credentials.  </p> <p>This is where vulnerability scanning comes into play.

A presentation by former NSA TAO Chief Rob Joyce talks about the process to \"hunt\" Sysadmins. Joyce, 2016  By separating the accounts with administrative access to clients, servers and domain controllers this will limit the credentials an adversary can obtain to move to a server or domain controller.  What does administrative account separation really mean?  Create separate user accounts for each class of system, e.g. clients, servers, network devices, domain controllers and security devices.  By using separate accounts based on class of system it will limit credentials the adversary is able to obtain should they gain access.

This will allow the organization to create Access Control Lists (ACL) on layer 3 interfaces or rules in host based firewalls to restrict/allow access for management systems.  In an ideal environment, each device type would be segmented into unique subnets based on role and access to these devices would be restricted to only required protocols.  See table 1 as an example.

First, I confirm the nature of the outage\u2014what systems or users are affected, and whether it's local or widespread. I check monitoring tools and logs for alerts, error messages, or anomalies that coincide with the reported time.  Next, I verify the health of critical services\u2014network connectivity, DNS, load balancers, and core infrastructure like servers or VMs. I\u2019ll also look at recent changes or deployments that might have caused the issue. If needed, I escalate or pull in relevant teams early to avoid delays.  Throughout the process, I document findings and communicate status updates to stakeholders. Once resolved, I perform a root cause analysis and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Explain the difference between TCP and UDP.  <ul> <li>Example answer: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented, which means it establishes a reliable connection between sender and receiver. It ensures that all data packets arrive in order, checks for errors, and retransmits lost packets. It\u2019s used for applications where accuracy matters, like web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS) or email.  UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless and faster but doesn't guarantee delivery, order, or error checking. It\u2019s used in scenarios where speed is more critical than reliability, like video streaming, online gaming, or VoIP.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>How do you stay up to date with the latest technologies?  <ul> <li>Example answer: I stay current by following a mix of trusted sources and hands-on practice. I regularly read industry blogs, security advisories, and technical sites like Ars Technica, Stack Overflow, and vendor documentation. I also follow relevant subreddits, newsletters, and watch conference talks or webinars when time allows.  On top of that, I maintain a lab environment where I can test new tools, scripts, or OS features. Staying hands-on helps me not just understand the theory, but also how things behave in practice. I also try to engage with peers or communities to exchange ideas and learn from real-world scenarios.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Describe how DNS works.  <ul> <li>Example answer: DNS, or Domain Name System, translates human-friendly domain names like example.com into IP addresses like 93.184.216.34, which computers use to communicate.  When you enter a URL in your browser, your system first checks its local DNS cache. If it\u2019s not there, the request goes to a recursive DNS resolver, which queries authoritative DNS servers in steps\u2014starting from the root, then the top-level domain (like .com), and finally the domain\u2019s authoritative server. That server returns the correct IP address, and your system can then connect to the destination server.  This entire process usually takes milliseconds and is critical for internet functionality.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>What\u2019s the difference between authentication and authorization?  <ul> <li>Example answer: Authentication is about verifying who someone is. It's the process of confirming identity\u2014like entering a username and password, or using MFA to log in.  Authorization is about determining what that person is allowed to do after they\u2019re authenticated. It controls access to resources, like whether a user can view, edit, or delete a file.  In short: Authentication = identity, Authorization = permissions.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Please describe your experience with system hardening and security configurations.  <ul> <li>Example answer: I\u2019ve worked extensively on system hardening across both Linux and Windows environments. My approach typically starts with applying security baselines\u2014like CIS Benchmarks or DISA STIGs\u2014depending on the environment and compliance requirements.   For Linux systems, I disable unnecessary services, enforce strong SSH configurations, implement file integrity monitoring, and configure proper permissions and audit rules. On Windows, I focus on Group Policy configurations, disabling legacy protocols, enforcing strong password policies, and enabling logging and auditing.  I also ensure systems are regularly patched, use firewalls and endpoint protection, and review configurations as part of change management. When possible, I automate hardening steps using scripts or configuration management tools like Ansible or PowerShell DSC to maintain consistency.  Security is a continuous process, so I also conduct periodic reviews, vulnerability scans, and compliance checks to ensure systems stay secure over time.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Describe your experience documenting risk findings and countermeasure recommendations in briefings, reports, and other program deliverables.  <ul> <li>Example answer: I have extensive experience documenting risk findings and providing actionable countermeasures in various formats, including technical reports, executive summaries, and client briefings. I tailor the language and depth based on the audience\u2014clear and concise for leadership, detailed and technical for engineers.  Each finding includes a description of the issue, its potential impact, risk rating, and evidence, followed by practical remediation steps aligned with industry standards like NIST, CIS, or vendor best practices. I\u2019ve also presented findings in stakeholder briefings, ensuring risks are understood and prioritized for mitigation. Deliverables are structured, peer-reviewed, and tracked for follow-up when needed.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Describe baseline configurations and their importance.  <ul> <li>Example answser: Baseline configurations are standardized system settings that define a secure and stable starting point for operating systems, applications, and devices. They include things like user permissions, service settings, patch levels, firewall rules, and audit policies.  Having baselines is important because they ensure consistency across systems, reduce attack surfaces, and help maintain compliance with security frameworks like NIST, CIS, or ISO. They also make it easier to detect deviations or unauthorized changes, which can be signs of misconfiguration or compromise. In short, baselines are critical for securing environments and supporting efficient, repeatable deployments.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Describe common network topologies and considerations for security.  <ul> <li>Example answer: Common network topologies include star, bus, ring, mesh, and hybrid designs. In modern enterprise environments, the star topology is most common, where all devices connect to a central switch or router. Mesh topologies are used in high-availability or critical systems where redundancy and fault tolerance are key.  From a security standpoint, segmentation is crucial\u2014using VLANs, firewalls, and DMZs to isolate sensitive systems and limit lateral movement. Network topologies should also support monitoring (via SPAN ports or TAPs), enforce access control, and minimize single points of failure.  Additional considerations include applying the principle of least privilege, encrypting traffic, and ensuring strong perimeter defenses. A well-designed topology balances performance, resilience, and security.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>How would you use Phishing to gain access on an internal network host?  <ul> <li>Example answer: In a controlled and authorized penetration test, phishing can be used to simulate a real-world attack and assess an organization\u2019s security awareness and email defenses. I would start by crafting a realistic pretext\u2014perhaps a fake internal service notification or file-sharing request\u2014tailored to the target environment using publicly available information or internal naming conventions.  The phishing email would contain either a malicious attachment (like an obfuscated macro-enabled document) or a link to a cloned login page designed to capture credentials. If the payload is delivered, it could initiate a reverse shell or beacon back to a C2 server, giving me a foothold on the internal network.  Once initial access is established, I would enumerate the host, pivot if needed, and escalate privileges\u2014while strictly following rules of engagement and reporting all findings with remediation recommendations.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>What is a TCP/IP port?  <ul> <li>Example answer: A TCP/IP port is a logical endpoint used to identify specific processes or services on a device within a network. While an IP address identifies the host, the port number specifies the particular application or service listening on that host.   For example, web servers typically listen on port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS. TCP and UDP both use port numbers, ranging from 0 to 65535, with ports 0\u20131023 being \"well-known ports\" assigned to common services.  Ports allow multiple services to run on the same IP address without conflict. They're essential for enabling structured communication between devices over the internet or internal networks.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Describe your experience and qualifications in preparing formal reports for management. What type of reports did you prepare, what was their purpose, and who was the audience? Please include as much detail as possible including whether the report was a one-time effort, ongoing, and the various components of the report.  <ul> <li>Example answer: I have extensive experience preparing formal reports for various levels of management, from technical leads to executive leadership. These reports have ranged from one-time assessments to ongoing deliverables as part of a larger security or IT operations program.  One example includes risk assessment reports delivered after penetration tests or vulnerability assessments. These were detailed documents that included an executive summary, methodology, scope, key findings, technical details, risk ratings (based on likelihood and impact), and prioritized remediation recommendations. The audience typically included both technical teams (who needed actionable details) and senior managers or CISOs (who needed a clear understanding of the business impact and risk posture).  I also produced monthly and quarterly operational reports for system health, patch compliance, and incident response metrics. These reports helped leadership track security KPIs, monitor SLA compliance, and make informed decisions about resourcing and strategic direction. They often included visualizations (charts, graphs) and trend analysis to show progress or recurring issues.  In addition, I\u2019ve written change control documentation, policy review summaries, and post-incident reports that followed structured templates. These required cross-team coordination, validation of timelines and data, and a focus on clarity and accuracy.  Across all these efforts, I made it a point to tailor the level of technical detail based on the audience and ensured that each report clearly conveyed why it matters, what the risks are, and what steps need to be taken next.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Describe your experience in creating and making presentations, facilitating meetings and/or conducting training for small and large groups. What steps would you take to prepare for the presentation or training? How would you handle positive and negative feedback during the presentation, training or meeting?  <ul> <li>Example answer: I have extensive experience creating and delivering presentations, facilitating technical meetings, and conducting training sessions for both small and large audiences\u2014including engineers, analysts, managers, and executive leadership. My sessions have ranged from hands-on technical workshops and security awareness training to strategic briefings and red team debriefs.  When preparing, I start by defining the audience and objective\u2014understanding who I\u2019m speaking to and what they need to learn or take away. I outline the key points, organize the content logically, and build slide decks or lab environments as needed. For technical training, I often include live demonstrations or hands-on labs to reinforce concepts. I also test all materials in advance, anticipate likely questions, and prepare supporting documentation or takeaway resources.  For delivery, I keep the tone engaging, use clear visuals, and encourage participation. I tailor the level of technical detail to the audience and pace the session to allow time for questions and discussion.  Regarding feedback, I always welcome it\u2014positive or negative. Positive feedback reinforces what\u2019s working, and I thank the individual and often encourage them to share with the group. For negative feedback, I stay calm and professional. If it\u2019s constructive, I acknowledge it and either address it on the spot or follow up afterward if it requires deeper discussion. If it\u2019s disruptive or off-topic, I refocus the session while keeping the environment respectful.  I view every session as an opportunity for continuous improvement and usually gather post-event feedback to fine-tune future presentations or trainings.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Please briefly explain how you pursue learning new cyber skills.  This would be a good example of talking about things you have learned in your classes/certifications and how that would pertain to securing an environment.  <ul> <li>Example answer: I pursue new cyber skills through a combination of formal training, certifications, and hands-on practice. I regularly enroll in courses from platforms like Offensive Security, SANS, and TryHackMe, and I\u2019ve earned certifications that emphasize both theoretical and practical skills\u2014such as [insert certs like OSCP, Security+, etc.]. These courses have helped me deepen my understanding of topics like vulnerability management, privilege escalation, and network defense.  Beyond structured learning, I maintain a home lab and participate in CTFs to apply new techniques in a safe environment. This hands-on approach allows me to simulate attacks, test defenses, and understand how to harden systems effectively. The skills I\u2019ve developed directly translate to securing environments\u2014whether it\u2019s identifying misconfigurations, detecting malicious behavior, or improving incident response readiness.  </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Training/jobhunting/#references","title":"References","text":""},{"location":"Training/jobhunting/#career-advice","title":"Career Advice","text":""},{"location":"Training/jobhunting/#example-resume","title":"Example Resume","text":""},{"location":"Training/jobhunting/#indeed","title":"Indeed","text":""},{"location":"Training/jobhunting/#ai-resume-design","title":"AI Resume Design","text":""},{"location":"Training/jobhunting/#easy-resume","title":"Easy Resume","text":""},{"location":"Training/linux/","title":"Linux","text":"<p>Linux is an open-source operating system widely used in the IT industry for servers, workstations, and embedded systems.
