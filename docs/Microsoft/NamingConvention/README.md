## Section 1 - Naming Standards for Workstations and Laptops:

1. Objects in this classification include:  Workstations, Desktops, Laptops, Tablet PC’s, and windows mobile devices.  Windows still has a 15 character limit for NetBIOS names, so this example is designed to maintain that limit.
2. Objects in this classification will be named using the following breakdown.

## Section 15 – ACL, USR and CMP group examples of implementation:

This section is designed to provide an example for how to implement role based access.  It can be used for both user and administrator delegation.  Depending on the size of the organization, it could be very manpower intensive to implement, but provides a lot of value in the end.  For the job title 

1. File Share permissions – The XYZACL_ group is applied as NTFS permissions on a shared folder for a department, with the XYZUSR_ groups nested inside.

Example of Role Based security groups used on a file server

![alt text](../../images/naming-convention-rolebasedgroups-fileshare.png "naming-convention-rolebasedgroups-fileshare")

2. Workstation Built-in Administrators group – The XYZACL_Workstation_LocalAdmins is added to the built-in Administrators group of every client using Group Policy Preferences (GPP), with the XYZUSR_ groupname, for the Help Desk Administrator accounts, nested inside.

Example of Role Based security group used for local administrative access of clients

![alt text](../../images/naming-convention-rolebasedgroups-localadmin.png "naming-convention-rolebasedgroups-localadmin")

3. Group Policy Permissions – This would allow the filtering of a GPO that is applied to only a specific group of computers.  The same could be done for user accounts using USR groups.

## Section 16 – Active Directory OU Structure based on resources:

1. This document is designed to give an example of an OU structure based on resources.  Often times OU structure is designed by physical location but the objects are not treated any different from a security perspective.  If the structure is designed using resources as a base, other sub OUs can created under each resource to further break down objects by physical location, department or function type if needed.  This allows applying GPOs at the resource level so all objects have the base GPO, but still allows deviations by applying another GPO to the subordinate OU.

domain.com
  - orgname (I prefer to create a root level OU and create resource OUs under it.  This makes for a cleaner interface.  It is also usefull for a large enterprise that has multiple departments, each with their own IT department)
    - computers
      - clients
        - HR
        - IT
        - OPS

        - Database
        - Web
    - contacts
    - distributionlists
      - admin
      - organizational
    - securitygroups (Separating OUs by function allows easier delegation for different teams and also easier to find when manually searching)
      - activedirectory (These security groups should be used Active Directory delegations)
      - file (These security groups are used for NTFS permissions no network shares)
