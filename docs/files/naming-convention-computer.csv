[Here is a good reference for CA city name codes](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/structur/strmaint/brlog/table_c.htm)  Each state should have a state government website with similar codes.  This site has some cities with 4 character abbreviations but in order to maintain the overall consistency with other areas of this document use only 3 characters.

If necessary to ensure uniqueness of active devices replace the last character with an alphabetical character.
