### Deploy YubiKey in Microsoft 365  
Register a security key  
-----------------------  

You must create your security key and give it a unique PIN before you can sign in to your work or school account using the key. You may have up to 10 keys registered with your account.  

1.  Go to the My Profile page at [My Account](https://myaccount.microsoft.com) and sign in if you haven't already done so.  
    
2.  Select **Security Info**, select **Add method**, and then select **Security key** from the **Add a method** list.  
      
    ![Add method box, with Security key selected](../images/Microsoft365-Azure-AddMethod.png)  
    
3.  Select **Add**, and then select the type of security key you have, either USB device or NFC device.  
      
    ![Choose whether you have a USB or NFC type of security key](../images/Microsoft365-Azure-SecurityKey.png)  
    
    **Note:** If you aren't sure which type of security key you have, refer to the manufacturer's documentation. If you aren't sure about the manufacturer, contact your organization's help desk for assistance.  
    
4.  Make sure that you have your security key physically available, and then on the **Security key** page, select **Next**.  
      
     
    
5.  In the **Setting up your new sign-in method** page, select **Next**, and then:  
    
    *   If your security key is a USB device, insert your security key into the USB port of your device.  
        
    *   If your security key is an NFC device, tap your security key to your reader.  
        
    
6.  If you're using Chrome or Edge, the browser might prioritize registration of a passkey that's stored on a mobile device over a passkey that's stored on a security key.  
    
    *   Beginning with Windows 11 version 23H2, you can sign in with your work or school account and click **Next**. Below **More choices**, choose **Security key** and click **Next**.

    *   On earlier versions of Windows, the browser may show the QR pairing screen to register a passkey that's stored on another mobile device. To register a passkey that's stored on a security key instead, insert your security key and touch it to continue.

8.  Select **Next**.  
    
9.  Return to the **Security info** page, type a name you'll recognize later for your new security key, and then select **Next**.
