## [Conditional Access Persistent Browser Sessions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-all-users-persistent-browser)  
Implementing a Conditional Access policy to enforce session timeouts for authentication is a critical security best practice in Microsoft 365 environments. By limiting the duration of authenticated sessions, you reduce the window of opportunity for unauthorized access in cases where credentials are compromised or sessions are left unattended. Session timeouts help ensure that users must periodically reauthenticate, reinforcing identity verification and reducing the risk of persistent access by attackers using stolen tokens or devices. This approach aligns with the principles of Zero Trust by verifying trust continuously and limiting implicit trust over time, thereby strengthening your organization's overall security posture.
