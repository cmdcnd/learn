Capture the Flag (CTF) is a popular cybersecurity competition that involves multiple teams competing to solve a series of challenges designed to test their knowledge and skills in various areas of cybersecurity. The goal of the competition is to capture the "flag" which is a specific piece of information or code hidden within the challenges. The challenges in a CTF can range from cryptography, steganography, web application security, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and many more. CTFs provide an opportunity for cybersecurity enthusiasts to showcase their problem-solving abilities, creativity, and technical skills in a fun and competitive environment. They are also an excellent way for organizations to identify and recruit talented individuals with a passion for cybersecurity.
