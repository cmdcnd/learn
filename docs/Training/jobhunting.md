## Resumes  
To write an effective resume, tailor it to each job, highlight achievements with quantifiable results, use action verbs, and ensure it's clear, concise, and error-free with professional formatting.  There is no one right way to format a resume, just make it organized and well laid out.  Try not to go past 2 pages.  

- Tailor Your Resume:  
    - Research the job description: Carefully analyze the job posting and identify the required skills, experience, and keywords.  
    - Customize your resume: Highlight the skills and experience that are most relevant to the specific position you're applying for.  
    - Use keywords: Incorporate keywords from the job description throughout your resume to help it pass through automated systems.  

- Highlight Achievements and Quantify Results:  
    - Focus on accomplishments: Instead of simply listing job responsibilities, focus on the results you achieved and the impact you made.  
    - Use action verbs: Start your bullet points with strong action verbs that showcase your accomplishments.  
    - Quantify your achievements: Use numbers and data to demonstrate the impact of your work.  

- Format for Readability and Impact:   
    - Use a professional font: Choose a clean, easy-to-read font like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman.  
    - Maintain consistent formatting: Use bullet points, headings, and subheadings to organize your resume and make it easy to scan.  
    - Keep it concise: Aim for a one-page resume, especially for entry-level or early-career positions.  
    - Proofread carefully: Check for any spelling or grammatical errors before submitting your resume.   
    - Use appropriate margins: One-inch margins on all sides are generally recommended.  

- Content and Structure:  
    - Contact Information: Include your full name, phone number, email address, and LinkedIn profile URL (optional).  
    - Summary/Objective (Optional): Consider including a brief summary or objective statement that highlights your key skills and career goals.  
    - Work Experience: List your work experience in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent position.  
    - Skills: Include a dedicated section for your skills, both hard and soft skills, that are relevant to the job you're applying for.  
    - Education: List your educational background, including degrees, certifications, and relevant coursework.  
    - Projects/Volunteer Experience (Optional): If relevant, include any personal projects or volunteer experience that showcase your skills and experience.  

## Job Interviews  
This is probably the hardest part of searcing for a job, but there are some tips you can do to make the process a bit easier.  Most interviews are going to have some common questions that you should have memorized with pre-canned answers.  Generally for Governement interviews, you are asked a question and the interviewers are not allowed to ask follow up questions or provide any further guidance, aside from maybe repeating the question.  The key is to try and answer succinctly, but provide enough detail to show you understand the topic.  If you're unsure about a question or lack in-depth knowledge of the topic, provide a concise response. Avoid over-explaining or using filler to compensate.  It is also ok to say you don't have any experience.  

### Behavioral/Problem Solving Questions  
- Give me an example of a difficult problem you solved.  
- Tell me about a time when you had to learn a new technology quickly.  
- Describe a situation where you had a conflict with a teammate or coworker. How did you resolve it?  
- Have you ever made a mistake at work? How did you handle it?  
- Tell me about a project you’re most proud of.  

### Technical/Knowledge-Based Questions  
- What are the steps you take when troubleshooting an outage?  
    - Example answer: When troubleshooting an outage, I start with scoping and triage. First, I confirm the nature of the outage—what systems or users are affected, and whether it's local or widespread. I check monitoring tools and logs for alerts, error messages, or anomalies that coincide with the reported time.  Next, I verify the health of critical services—network connectivity, DNS, load balancers, and core infrastructure like servers or VMs. I’ll also look at recent changes or deployments that might have caused the issue. If needed, I escalate or pull in relevant teams early to avoid delays.  Throughout the process, I document findings and communicate status updates to stakeholders. Once resolved, I perform a root cause analysis and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence.  
- Explain the difference between TCP and UDP.  
    - Example answer: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented, which means it establishes a reliable connection between sender and receiver. It ensures that all data packets arrive in order, checks for errors, and retransmits lost packets. It’s used for applications where accuracy matters, like web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS) or email.  UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless and faster but doesn't guarantee delivery, order, or error checking. It’s used in scenarios where speed is more critical than reliability, like video streaming, online gaming, or VoIP.  
- How do you stay up to date with the latest technologies?  
    - Example answer: I stay current by following a mix of trusted sources and hands-on practice. I regularly read industry blogs, security advisories, and technical sites like Ars Technica, Stack Overflow, and vendor documentation. I also follow relevant subreddits, newsletters, and watch conference talks or webinars when time allows.  On top of that, I maintain a lab environment where I can test new tools, scripts, or OS features. Staying hands-on helps me not just understand the theory, but also how things behave in practice. I also try to engage with peers or communities to exchange ideas and learn from real-world scenarios.  
- Describe how DNS works.  
    - Example answer: DNS, or Domain Name System, translates human-friendly domain names like example.com into IP addresses like 93.184.216.34, which computers use to communicate.  When you enter a URL in your browser, your system first checks its local DNS cache. If it’s not there, the request goes to a recursive DNS resolver, which queries authoritative DNS servers in steps—starting from the root, then the top-level domain (like .com), and finally the domain’s authoritative server. That server returns the correct IP address, and your system can then connect to the destination server.  This entire process usually takes milliseconds and is critical for internet functionality.  
- What’s the difference between authentication and authorization?  
    - Example answer: Authentication is about verifying who someone is. It's the process of confirming identity—like entering a username and password, or using MFA to log in.  Authorization is about determining what that person is allowed to do after they’re authenticated. It controls access to resources, like whether a user can view, edit, or delete a file.  In short: Authentication = identity, Authorization = permissions.  
- Please describe your experience with system hardening and security configurations.  
    - Example answer: I’ve worked extensively on system hardening across both Linux and Windows environments. My approach typically starts with applying security baselines—like CIS Benchmarks or DISA STIGs—depending on the environment and compliance requirements. 
     For Linux systems, I disable unnecessary services, enforce strong SSH configurations, implement file integrity monitoring, and configure proper permissions and audit rules. On Windows, I focus on Group Policy configurations, disabling legacy protocols, enforcing strong password policies, and enabling logging and auditing.  I also ensure systems are regularly patched, use firewalls and endpoint protection, and review configurations as part of change management. When possible, I automate hardening steps using scripts or configuration management tools like Ansible or PowerShell DSC to maintain consistency.  Security is a continuous process, so I also conduct periodic reviews, vulnerability scans, and compliance checks to ensure systems stay secure over time.  
- Describe your experience documenting risk findings and countermeasure recommendations in briefings, reports, and other program deliverables.  
    - Example answer: I have extensive experience documenting risk findings and providing actionable countermeasures in various formats, including technical reports, executive summaries, and client briefings. I tailor the language and depth based on the audience—clear and concise for leadership, detailed and technical for engineers.  Each finding includes a description of the issue, its potential impact, risk rating, and evidence, followed by practical remediation steps aligned with industry standards like NIST, CIS, or vendor best practices. I’ve also presented findings in stakeholder briefings, ensuring risks are understood and prioritized for mitigation. Deliverables are structured, peer-reviewed, and tracked for follow-up when needed.  
- Describe baseline configurations and their importance.  
    - Example answser: Baseline configurations are standardized system settings that define a secure and stable starting point for operating systems, applications, and devices. They include things like user permissions, service settings, patch levels, firewall rules, and audit policies.  Having baselines is important because they ensure consistency across systems, reduce attack surfaces, and help maintain compliance with security frameworks like NIST, CIS, or ISO. They also make it easier to detect deviations or unauthorized changes, which can be signs of misconfiguration or compromise. In short, baselines are critical for securing environments and supporting efficient, repeatable deployments.  
- Describe common network topologies and considerations for security.  
    - Example answer: Common network topologies include star, bus, ring, mesh, and hybrid designs. In modern enterprise environments, the star topology is most common, where all devices connect to a central switch or router. Mesh topologies are used in high-availability or critical systems where redundancy and fault tolerance are key.  From a security standpoint, segmentation is crucial—using VLANs, firewalls, and DMZs to isolate sensitive systems and limit lateral movement. Network topologies should also support monitoring (via SPAN ports or TAPs), enforce access control, and minimize single points of failure.  Additional considerations include applying the principle of least privilege, encrypting traffic, and ensuring strong perimeter defenses. A well-designed topology balances performance, resilience, and security.  
- How would you use Phishing to gain access on an internal network host?  
    - Example answer: In a controlled and authorized penetration test, phishing can be used to simulate a real-world attack and assess an organization’s security awareness and email defenses. I would start by crafting a realistic pretext—perhaps a fake internal service notification or file-sharing request—tailored to the target environment using publicly available information or internal naming conventions.  The phishing email would contain either a malicious attachment (like an obfuscated macro-enabled document) or a link to a cloned login page designed to capture credentials. If the payload is delivered, it could initiate a reverse shell or beacon back to a C2 server, giving me a foothold on the internal network.  Once initial access is established, I would enumerate the host, pivot if needed, and escalate privileges—while strictly following rules of engagement and reporting all findings with remediation recommendations.  
- What is a TCP/IP port?  
    - Example answer: A TCP/IP port is a logical endpoint used to identify specific processes or services on a device within a network. While an IP address identifies the host, the port number specifies the particular application or service listening on that host. 
     For example, web servers typically listen on port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS. TCP and UDP both use port numbers, ranging from 0 to 65535, with ports 0–1023 being "well-known ports" assigned to common services.  Ports allow multiple services to run on the same IP address without conflict. They're essential for enabling structured communication between devices over the internet or internal networks.  
- Describe your experience and qualifications in preparing formal reports for management. What type of reports did you prepare, what was their purpose, and who was the audience? Please include as much detail as possible including whether the report was a one-time effort, ongoing, and the various components of the report.  
    - Example answer: I have extensive experience preparing formal reports for various levels of management, from technical leads to executive leadership. These reports have ranged from one-time assessments to ongoing deliverables as part of a larger security or IT operations program.  One example includes risk assessment reports delivered after penetration tests or vulnerability assessments. These were detailed documents that included an executive summary, methodology, scope, key findings, technical details, risk ratings (based on likelihood and impact), and prioritized remediation recommendations. The audience typically included both technical teams (who needed actionable details) and senior managers or CISOs (who needed a clear understanding of the business impact and risk posture).  I also produced monthly and quarterly operational reports for system health, patch compliance, and incident response metrics. These reports helped leadership track security KPIs, monitor SLA compliance, and make informed decisions about resourcing and strategic direction. They often included visualizations (charts, graphs) and trend analysis to show progress or recurring issues.  In addition, I’ve written change control documentation, policy review summaries, and post-incident reports that followed structured templates. These required cross-team coordination, validation of timelines and data, and a focus on clarity and accuracy.  Across all these efforts, I made it a point to tailor the level of technical detail based on the audience and ensured that each report clearly conveyed why it matters, what the risks are, and what steps need to be taken next.  
- Describe your experience in creating and making presentations, facilitating meetings and/or conducting training for small and large groups. What steps would you take to prepare for the presentation or training? How would you handle positive and negative feedback during the presentation, training or meeting?  
    - Example answer: I have extensive experience creating and delivering presentations, facilitating technical meetings, and conducting training sessions for both small and large audiences—including engineers, analysts, managers, and executive leadership. My sessions have ranged from hands-on technical workshops and security awareness training to strategic briefings and red team debriefs.  When preparing, I start by defining the audience and objective—understanding who I’m speaking to and what they need to learn or take away. I outline the key points, organize the content logically, and build slide decks or lab environments as needed. For technical training, I often include live demonstrations or hands-on labs to reinforce concepts. I also test all materials in advance, anticipate likely questions, and prepare supporting documentation or takeaway resources.  For delivery, I keep the tone engaging, use clear visuals, and encourage participation. I tailor the level of technical detail to the audience and pace the session to allow time for questions and discussion.  Regarding feedback, I always welcome it—positive or negative. Positive feedback reinforces what’s working, and I thank the individual and often encourage them to share with the group. For negative feedback, I stay calm and professional. If it’s constructive, I acknowledge it and either address it on the spot or follow up afterward if it requires deeper discussion. If it’s disruptive or off-topic, I refocus the session while keeping the environment respectful.  I view every session as an opportunity for continuous improvement and usually gather post-event feedback to fine-tune future presentations or trainings.  
- Please briefly explain how you pursue learning new cyber skills.  This would be a good example of talking about things you have learned in your classes/certifications and how that would pertain to securing an environment.  
    - Example answer: I pursue new cyber skills through a combination of formal training, certifications, and hands-on practice. I regularly enroll in courses from platforms like Offensive Security, SANS, and TryHackMe, and I’ve earned certifications that emphasize both theoretical and practical skills—such as [insert certs like OSCP, Security+, etc.]. These courses have helped me deepen my understanding of topics like vulnerability management, privilege escalation, and network defense.  Beyond structured learning, I maintain a home lab and participate in CTFs to apply new techniques in a safe environment. This hands-on approach allows me to simulate attacks, test defenses, and understand how to harden systems effectively. The skills I’ve developed directly translate to securing environments—whether it’s identifying misconfigurations, detecting malicious behavior, or improving incident response readiness.
